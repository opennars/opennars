Example experience files are in directory Examples. 

- "test" contains individual unit tests

- "Example-NALn-*.txt" contains single step examples for most of the inference rules defined in NAL level n. The "edited" version contains English translations, and with the unrelated information removed; the "unedited" version contains the actual input/output data recorded by the "Save Experience" function of the GUI. The files can be loaded using the "Load Experience" function of the GUI. 

- "Example-MultiStep-edited" contains multi-step inference examples described in http://code.google.com/p/open-nars/wiki/MultiStepExamples

- "Example-NLP-edited" contains an example of natural language processing described in the AGI-13 paper "Natural Language Processing by Reasoning and Learning".
