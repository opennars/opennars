    <patham9_> when a goal task is processed, the following happens: In order to decide on whether it is relevant for the current situation, at first it is projected to the current time, then it is revised with previous "desires", then it is checked to what extent this projected revised desire is already fullfilled (which revises its budget) , if its below satisfaction threshold then it is pursued, if its an operation it is additionally checked if
    <patham9_> executed
    <patham9_> the consequences of this, to give examples, are a lot:
    <patham9_> 1 the system wont execute something if it has a strong objection against it. (example: it wont jump down again 5 meters if it previously observed that this damages it, no matter if it thinks about that situation again or not)
    <patham9_> 2. the system wont lose time with thoughts about already satisfied goals (due to budget shrinking proportional to satisfaction)
    <patham9_> 3. the system wont execute and pursue what is already satisfied
    <patham9_> 4. the system wont try to execute and pursue things in the current moment which are "sheduled" to be in the future.
    <patham9_> 5. the system wont pursue a goal it already pursued for the same reason (due to revision, it is related to 1)
